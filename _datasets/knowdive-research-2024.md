  This page describes the process and outcome of the engineering of a knowledge graph about “KnowDive Research Group”. The graph consists of a knowledge layer and a data layer. Entities are instances of the E-type classes, which have their own data properties, as well as object properties which connect them. The project has been implemented following the iTelos methodology which provides a schema to follow implementing phase after phase and achieving intermediate and eventually final results. This is done with the aim to not only create a graph for the specific case in hand, but to also allow for potential reuse and expansion.
