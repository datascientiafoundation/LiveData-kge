  Access to sports facilities and events plays a crucial role in improving the quality of life in Trentino Province. Our project focuses on creating a Knowledge Graph to consolidate information about these resources, offering a unified platform for residents, tourists, and local authorities. With this tool, we aim to inspire active lifestyles, foster community engagement, and support informed decision-making. Ultimately, this initiative promotes public health and cultivates a vibrant sports culture in the region.
