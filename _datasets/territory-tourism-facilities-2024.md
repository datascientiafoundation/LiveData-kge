organization: KnowDive
notes: >-
  The goal of this project is to build a Knowledge Graph (KG) that stores, organizes, and provides easy access to information about tourist facilities in the Trentino region, with a specific focus on outdoor activities. The KG will serve as a centralized knowledge hub, connecting tourists, travel planners, and local businesses to the wealth of outdoor opportunities the region has to offer, such as hiking trails, walks, climbing spots, cycle routes and so on.
