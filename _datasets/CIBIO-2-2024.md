title: 2024 - The human microbiome and person-to-person interactions
organization: KnowDive
notes: >-
  The microbiome plays a fundamental role in understanding human health and social interactions. This project focuses on systematically organizing data on microbiome transmission patterns, incorporating both biological and social dimensions. By leveraging the Knowledge Graph (KG) approach, we aim to provide researchers and clinicians with tools to explore the dynamics of microbial diversity and transmission across populations.
