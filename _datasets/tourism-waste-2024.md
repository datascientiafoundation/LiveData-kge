title: 2024 - Tourism and Waste Management in Trentino
organization: KnowDive
notes: >-
  The purpose of our project is to offer comprehensive data regarding waste management and its relationship with tourism in the Province of Trento. The final Knowledge Graph (KG) will serve as a valuable tool for various stakeholders, including tourists, facility owners, and waste management authorities, by providing accessible information on waste disposal locations, recycling options, and the environmental impact of tourism on local waste management systems. Additionally, the KG will support researchers and experts by enabling in-depth analysis of the interactions between tourism activities and waste generation, promoting evidence-based decisionmaking in administration and policy development.
