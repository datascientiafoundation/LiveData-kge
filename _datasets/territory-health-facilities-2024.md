organization: KnowDive
notes: >-
  I want to build a Knowledge Graph (KG) that provides comprehensive, accessible, and structured information about health facilities across Trentino. The KG will help residents locate essential healthcare services, such as hospitals, pharmacies, residential care, and semi-residential care, based on type, availability, and capacity. It will support informed healthcare choices, allowing users to find facilities suited to their specific needs, especially in cases requiring urgent or specialized care.
