  The objective of this project is to build a knowledge graph that assists students in planning their trips from one location to another using public transportation in an efficient and comfortable manner. This tool aims to facilitate informed decision-making and enhance studentsâ€™ overall university experience. This has been achieved by integrating historical data on student commutes and activities, public transportation information, and points of interest.
